# GlowUp Companion (Private Repository)

This is the internal development repo for GlowUp Companion — a private, early-stage prototype of a warm, emotionally steady AI companion app.

GlowUp’s core goals:
- Provide a grounding, consistent conversational presence.
- Reflect users’ thoughts back clearly, without judgment.
- Support confidence, emotional stability, and self-understanding.
- Deliver a calm, modern, AI-driven companionship experience.

## Status
This repo is **private** and **pre-MVP**. The UI, onboarding flows, and tone guidelines are actively evolving. None of the code, prompts, or flows here should be considered final.
